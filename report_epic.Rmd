## Methods
Data from `r  merged_data2 %>% pull("preopdate") %>% min %>% (lubridate::date)` to `r  merged_data2 %>% pull("preopdate") %>% max %>% (lubridate::date)` were queried from the Epic electronic health record.
Patients were matched to hospital admission, discharge, billing and mortality data.
Records were filtered to include those with preoperative clinic visits with AD8 and SBT measured, surgery within 90 days of that clinic visit, and matching billing and discharge records.
A subset of surgical procedures were included into the analytical dataset, procedure codes for which are in the appendix. This restriction was intended to reduce confounding due to surgical complexity.
That is, we suspect that patients with impaired cognition may be selectively referred to medical vs surgical management of their conditions, and that patients with impaired cogition will be referred for surgeries with less physiologic stress.
These procedures were felt to be ones with little variation in overall surgical complexity which would contribute to this selection bias.


Because our principal outcomes (readmission, discharge to home) and inclusion critereon (procedure codes) are generated at the hospitalization level, we treat that as the unit of analysis.
Readmission in 30 days and length of stay was only considered for patients with discharge to home.

Association between preoperative cognitive impairment (defined as a Short Blessed Test >= 2 or a AD8 >= 5) was assesed using logistic regression models adjusting for surgical procedure type, sex, age using a 5 degree of freedom cublic spline, indicator variables for history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, active cancer, and congestive heart failure.  
Each hospitalization can have procedures qualifying in multiple categories; we created indicator variables for each procedure category and assumed additivity for hospitalizations with more than one type of procedure. 
Logisitic regression models with the same adjustment startegy were considered for readmission and near-term death.
A log-link generalized linear model (quasipoisson) with the same set of adjusting variables was used for length of stay.

Heterogeneity of association between abnormal cognition and outcomes was assessed using an expanded model with an interaction term and a score-test. 

To compare the predictive value of AD8 and SBT, we used two approaches.
First, we used a k-fold cross-validation method (K=100) fitting logistic regression models predicting each outcome using AD8 or SBT, then assessing the accuracy by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the hold-out sample. Each 100 pairs of accuracy metrics are then compared by a paired t-test.
Second, we used the Vuong test for non-nested models [https://doi.org/10.2307/1912557](https://doi.org/10.2307/1912557) implemented by the "nonnest2" package version 0.5-5.

All analysis was conducted using R 4.1.2. A repository containing the analysis code is available at [https://github.com/cryanking/cognition_discharge](https://github.com/cryanking/cognition_discharge)

## Notes from CRK
1. Gyn-onc cases are a little problematic. We detect that they have e.g. a hysterectomy in them, but they are also giant resections.
2. I replaced "lobectomy" (which is uncommon) with VATS. I think it might be a good idea to break the SB/CR and hysterectomy procedures into open vs not.
3. I do not have an easy way to scan for reason for readmission
4. Some of the exploratory outcomes are difficult: reoperation is hard to define, sepsis is not cleanly defined, troponins are not well recorded
5. None of the exploratory outcomes are meaningfully associated. I am happy to put that in an appendix.

## Results
The filtered dataset included `r merged_data2 %>% pull("CSN") %>% n_distinct` distinct patients with `r merged_data2 %>% pull("orlogid") %>% n_distinct` hospitalizations. 
Characteristics of the cohort and overall outcome rates are given in Table \@ref(tab:desc).
AD8 was abnormal (>=2) in `r merged_data2$AD8 %>% is_greater_than(2) %>% mean(na.rm=T) %>% multiply_by(100) %>% round(1)` percent of included patients; SBT was abnormal (>=5) in `r merged_data2$SBT %>% is_greater_than(5) %>% mean(na.rm=T) %>% multiply_by(100) %>% round(1)` percent of included patients.

The frequency of each type of surgery is displayed in \@ref(tab:descType). The frequencies do not add up to the number of hospitalizations because of multiple procedures per hospitalization.

We found that impaired cognition was `r if_else(coef_home[4] < .05, "" ,  "not ")` significantly associated with discharge to home (odds ratio `r paste0(exp(coef_home[2])%>% round(2) %>% sprintf(fmt="%.2f"), ", 95\\% CI ", ci_home)`, p = `r coef_home[4] %>% format.pval(eps=.001, digits=3)`).
For readmission in 30 days, impaired cognition was `r if_else(coef_readmit[4] < .05,"",  "not ")` a significant predictor (odds ratio `r paste0(exp(coef_readmit[2])%>% round(2) %>% sprintf(fmt="%.2f") , ", 95\\% CI ", ci_readmit)`, p = `r coef_readmit[3] %>% format.pval(eps=.001, digits=3)`).
Similarly for near-term death, impaired cognition was `r if_else(coef_death[4] < .05,"",  "not ")` a significant predictor (odds ratio `r paste0(exp(coef_death[2])%>% round(2) %>% sprintf(fmt="%.2f"), ", 95\\% CI ", ci_death)`, p = `r coef_death[4] %>% format.pval(eps=.001, digits=3)`).
Similarly, impaired cognition was `r if_else(coef_los[4] < .05,"",  "not ")` a significant predictor of length of stay (duration ratio `r paste0(exp(coef_los[3])%>% round(2) %>% sprintf(fmt="%.2f"), ", 95\\% CI ", ci_los)`, p = `r coef_los[4] %>%  sprintf(fmt="%.3f")`).

We found modest evidence of heterogeneity by type of surgery, although power for this question is limited by small sample sizes in some surgery types. A score test comparing models with and without interaction terms yielded a p-value of `r anova(inter_glm, dc_home_glm, test="Rao")  %>% select(starts_with("Pr"))  %>% extract2(2,1) %>% sprintf(fmt="%.3f")`
